# Ikon-Epic-Comparison
Name: Annika More

# Installations 
This program only requires R studio and C++ to be installed on your computer. The R script does load in a few 
packages at the very beginning. If you don't have them installed, you will just have to install them first before 
you can load them. 

# Summary of Project
For this project, I read in a Kaggle dataset containing all of the ski resorts on both the Ikon pass and the Epic pass. The dataset includes variables like vertical drop, average snow, whether it is limited or unlimited, etc. for each resort. The user has the option of different comparisons they would like to make between the resorts on both passes. They are able to pick as many comparisons as they like. It will output the comparisons for each option to a separate file on your computer. Additionally, I added an option for the user to choose if they would like to look at visualizations of the data. If they choose this option, it will run R passing the csv file through the command line, and R will create graphs using ggplot. These graphs can help the user better understand differences in the resorts and passes if they don't want to look at tables.
